            <p>
                Hi! I am MD Al-Amin Rahman, a web designer/developer focused on crafting great web experiences.
                Designing and Coding have been my passion since the days I started working with computers but I found
                myself into web design/development since 2020. I enjoy creating beautifully designed, intuitive and
                functional websites.
            </p>
